           <h3>Uploading images</h3>
           <p>You can upload images by clicking in the + icon in the centre of an empty placeholder. Select your image from the dialog that opens and it should appear</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h3>Linking from online</h3>
           <p>You can drag and drop any image from online. You need to be sure that the image you are dragging over is the source, however. If you drag an image that isn't the base URL an alert will pop-up. When this happens you can usually right-click the image you want and "open in a new tab". Drag this image over</p>
           <p>You can use the image below to try it out</p>
           <img src="https://www.google.co.uk/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" alt="" style="width:50px">

           <h3>Removing images</h3>
           <p>Images should be persistent once added. This means you can open new tabs, close the extension, etc, without losing the images. To remove them all you need to do is click. To get it back you will need to repeat the process how you put it there originally.</p>

           <h3>Rotating Images</h3>
           <p>There are currently two ways of dealing with vertical pictures:</p>
           <ul>
              <li>Rotate the image - the image will be rotated within the placeholder</li>
              <li>Rotate the placeholder (avoid) - the placeholder will be rotated to fit the image. This currently does not extend to printing.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>This seting is global and will ultimitely apply to all images.</p>

           <h3>Printing</h3>
           <p>There is no API for the Chrome Printer Page so you will need to marry up the settings:</p>
           <ul>
              <li>Remove Margins</li>
              <li>Add background graphics if you want black bars</li>
              <li>Set the page size</li>
              <li>Set the page orientation</li>
           </ul>
